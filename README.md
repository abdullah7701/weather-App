The HTML file provides the structure of the weather app, including a search input field for the user to enter a city, buttons to trigger the search, and containers to display the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast.

The CSS file contains styles to make the weather app visually appealing, including fonts, colors, spacing, and box-shadow effects.

The JavaScript file is responsible for handling user interactions. When the user clicks the search button, it retrieves the city input, constructs a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data for that city, and updates the UI with the retrieved information.
